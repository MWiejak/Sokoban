This project was created before I started to learn object-oriented programming. The board has graphical representation in turtle graphics and its shape is based on the "plansza1.txt" file (You can design your own board in this file). Characters which can be used in this file and their meanings are explained (in polish) at the beginning of the "Sokoban.py" file.
