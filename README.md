This project was done before I have started to learn about object-oriented programming. The board has graphical representation in turtle graphics and it is based on the "plansza1.txt" file which is a project of it. Characters which can be used in text board design and theirs meanings are explained (in Polish) at the beginning of the "Sokoban.py" file.
